# Geo-Quizz
This quiz game online (in French) is written in PHP. 

You can select two different databases : 
  - one for the French geography questions 
  - one for the Wordlwide geography questions.

-> For the 101 French departments, I use the official INSEE open-data sources which includes the new metropolitan regions.
-> For the world part, I use the official United Nation's list of 197 countries.

All the datas are updated (update : april 2017).

For each entity (French department or country), I add a link to consult the Wikipedia article about this area.

This script is still under progress, but I will be very happy to receive your contributions and advices :)

For the moment, this application is usable only for the French departments part... The world part is still under construction (big work to do) and will be ready soon (I hope) :X

But you can already test this web app online at : http://seb2lyon.site11.com/geo-quizz

See you soon on the road again :D
