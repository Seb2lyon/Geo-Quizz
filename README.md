# Geo-Quizz
This quiz game online (in French) is written in PHP. 

You can select two different databases : 
  - one for the French geography questions 
  - one for the Wordlwide geography questions.

-> For the 101 French departments, I use the official INSEE open-data sources which includes the new metropolitan regions.
-> For the world part, I use the official United Nation's list of 197 countries.

All the datas are updated (update : april 2017).

This script is still under progress, but I will be very happy to receive your contributions and advices :)

Once this application will be quite usable, I will upload it on the Internet ;)

See you soon on the road again :D
